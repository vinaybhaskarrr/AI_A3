Part A(Particle filter):
Here we took 1000 particles and distributed them according to the probability distribution in belief and then by
using transProbabilities we moved each particle to its corresponding positions and then added weight to the moved grid
by using pdf function guven in the code. And then updated belief matrix with these new weights and then normalised
the belief using normalized function in utils.

Part B(intelligent):
By using the edges in create world we will find all the adjacent edges to our current node and check the sum of all beliefs 
corresponding to each node and then we check whether these are greater than the threashold probability and then we remove these
which are greater than the threashold. And apply BFS on the remaining nodes by keeping goal state as the current checkpoint and 
then we will find the shortestpath and then update the goalPos to this node and the return those. Incase if there are no adjacent
node to the current node then it must be in the padding region so we will deal it differently. If no node satisfies threashold 
value then we will make moveForward as False and then return goalPos and moveForward.
